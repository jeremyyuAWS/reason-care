# AI-Generated Diagnostic Assessment

**Patient:** Sarah Johnson (P-2024-0847)  
**Date:** January 15, 2024  
**Generated by:** ReasonCare Multi-Agent Diagnostic System  

## Primary Diagnosis

**Unstable Angina Pectoris** (Confidence: 87%)

## Clinical Reasoning

### Specialist Agent Analysis

#### Cardiology Specialist Agent
- **Assessment:** Likely unstable angina based on symptom pattern, risk factors, and clinical presentation
- **Confidence:** 89%
- **Key Findings:**
  - Classic anginal pain pattern with exertional onset
  - Pain radiation to left arm is concerning  
  - Risk factors: DM, HTN, family history of CAD
  - New onset symptoms warrant urgent evaluation

#### Emergency Medicine Agent  
- **Assessment:** Moderate risk acute coronary syndrome requiring immediate rule-out protocol
- **Confidence:** 85%
- **Key Findings:**
  - HEART score assessment indicates moderate risk
  - Requires serial cardiac biomarkers
  - Continuous monitoring indicated

#### Internal Medicine Agent
- **Assessment:** Differential includes cardiac vs non-cardiac chest pain with consideration of comorbidities
- **Confidence:** 78%
- **Key Findings:**
  - Diabetes and hypertension increase cardiovascular risk
  - Symptoms consistent with cardiac etiology
  - Comprehensive workup needed

### Synthesized Assessment

The multi-agent analysis converges on **Unstable Angina Pectoris** as the most likely diagnosis based on:

1. **Symptom Pattern:** Classic anginal chest pain that is:
   - Exertional in nature
   - Described as dull, tight, pressure-like
   - Radiates to left arm
   - Relieved by rest

2. **Risk Factor Profile:**
   - Age 54 (postmenopausal female)
   - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
   - Hypertension  
   - Family history of coronary artery disease
   - Elevated LDL cholesterol

3. **Clinical Presentation:**
   - New onset symptoms (3 days)
   - Progressive pattern
   - Triggered by physical activity

## Differential Diagnosis

1. **Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)** - 15%
2. **Stable Angina with recent change** - 10% 
3. **Atypical chest pain** - 8%

## Immediate Recommendations

### Diagnostic Workup
- [ ] **Immediate 12-lead ECG**
- [ ] **Serial cardiac enzymes** (Troponin I q6h x3)
- [ ] **Comprehensive metabolic panel**
- [ ] **Complete blood count**
- [ ] **PT/PTT, INR**
- [ ] **Chest X-ray**
- [ ] **Stress testing within 24-48 hours** (if initial workup negative)

### Treatment Considerations
- [ ] **Dual antiplatelet therapy** (Aspirin + Clopidogrel) if no contraindications
- [ ] **Atorvastatin optimization** (consider high-intensity statin)
- [ ] **Beta-blocker** if no contraindications
- [ ] **ACE inhibitor continuation** (Lisinopril)
- [ ] **Diabetes management optimization**

### Monitoring & Follow-up
- [ ] **Continuous cardiac monitoring**
- [ ] **Vital sign monitoring q4h**
- [ ] **Urgent cardiology consultation**
- [ ] **Consider coronary angiography** based on risk stratification

## Risk Stratification

**HEART Score:** 6 (Moderate Risk)
- History: 2 (moderately suspicious)
- ECG: 0 (normal - pending)
- Age: 2 (45-65 years)
- Risk factors: 2 (â‰¥3 risk factors)
- Troponin: 0 (normal - pending)

## Disposition

**Admit for observation** with cardiac monitoring and serial biomarkers.
