# AI Guideline Updates - Post Case Review

**Case Reference:** P-2024-0847 (Sarah Johnson)  
**Date:** January 15, 2024  
**Update Version:** 2.1.3  
**Feedback Source:** Dr. Sarah Williams, MD (Cardiology Attending)  

## Guidelines Enhancement Summary

Based on the successful diagnostic case review, the following enhancements have been implemented in the ReasonCare AI diagnostic algorithms:

### 1. Diabetes-Cardiovascular Risk Integration ‚≠ê **HIGH PRIORITY**

#### Previous Algorithm:
```
IF diabetes_present = true THEN
  cardiovascular_risk += 1.5
```

#### Enhanced Algorithm:
```
IF diabetes_present = true THEN
  cardiovascular_risk += 2.2
  IF duration > 10_years THEN cardiovascular_risk += 0.5
  IF hba1c > 7.0 THEN cardiovascular_risk += 0.3
  ADD diabetes_specific_workup = [BNP, microalbumin, echo]
```

#### Rationale:
Dr. Williams emphasized that diabetes should be treated as a CAD risk equivalent, not just an additive risk factor. This aligns with 2019 ESC/EAS and 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol guidelines.

### 2. Gender-Specific Risk Assessment üîÑ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

#### Added Logic:
```
IF gender = "female" AND age > 50 THEN
  IF postmenopausal_status = true THEN
    cardiovascular_risk_multiplier *= 1.3
    ADD consideration = "postmenopausal cardiovascular risk"
```

#### Implementation:
- Enhanced risk weighting for postmenopausal women
- Updated symptom interpretation algorithms
- Added gender-specific diagnostic recommendations

### 3. High-Sensitivity Troponin Protocols üïí **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

#### Previous Protocol:
```
troponin_schedule = ["0h", "6h", "12h"]
```

#### Updated Protocol (2020 ESC Guidelines):
```
IF high_sensitivity_troponin_available = true THEN
  troponin_schedule = ["0h", "1h", "3h"]
ELSE
  troponin_schedule = ["0h", "6h", "12h"]
```

### 4. Multi-Agent Confidence Weighting üìä **LOW PRIORITY**

#### Cardiology Agent Weight: 
- Increased from 0.35 to 0.40 for chest pain cases
- Enhanced diabetes-specific reasoning pathways

#### Emergency Medicine Agent:
- Added rapid rule-out protocols
- Enhanced HEART score integration

#### Internal Medicine Agent:
- Strengthened comorbidity assessment
- Enhanced diabetes management integration

## Specific Diagnostic Enhancements

### Unstable Angina Recognition
```python
# Enhanced pattern recognition
angina_patterns = {
    "new_onset": confidence_boost = +0.15,
    "exertional": confidence_boost = +0.10,
    "radiation_left_arm": confidence_boost = +0.12,
    "diabetes_present": confidence_boost = +0.08,  # NEW
    "postmenopasual_female": confidence_boost = +0.05  # NEW
}
```

### Risk Stratification Updates
- HEART score calculation enhanced with diabetes weighting
- Added gender-specific risk modifiers
- Integrated HbA1c into cardiovascular risk assessment

## Treatment Recommendation Updates

### Statin Therapy
```
IF diabetes + suspected_cad THEN
  recommend_statin_intensity = "high"
  statin_dose_range = "atorvastatin 40-80mg daily"
  ldl_target = "<70 mg/dL"
```

### Comprehensive Diabetes Workup
```
diabetes_cardiovascular_workup = [
  "BNP or NT-proBNP",
  "HbA1c if >3 months old", 
  "Urine microalbumin",
  "Echocardiogram",
  "Diabetic retinopathy screening"
]
```
